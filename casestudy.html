      Case Study
    </h1>
    <h3 style="font-size: xxx-large">Overview:</h3>
    <p>
      myFlix is client-side based on its server-side code (REST API and
      database). A web app developed using the MERN stack provides users with
      information about movies, directors, and genres. Users can create an
      account, update their data, and create a list of favorite movies.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-size: xxx-large">Purpose and Context:</h3>
    <p>
      myFlix was a personal project built as a part of my web development course
      at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my mastery of full-stack JavaScript
      development. It uses React library to create the client-side of an
      application and the interface to make requests to and receive responses
      from the REST API endpoints developed on the server-side.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-size: xxx-large">Objective:</h3>
    <p>
      The project aimed to have an ambitious full-stack project I could add to
      my professional portfolio. I wanted to solve the problem of building the
      complete server-side and the client-side application from scratch.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-size: xxx-large">Duration:</h3>
    <p>
      It took me a considerable amount of time to complete this achievement. I
      had to familiarize myself with the component-based architecture, set React
      Development environment, Component lifecycle methods, configure react
      routes, and implement flux design patterns using the Redux library.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-size: xxx-large">Approach:</h3>
    <h4>Server-Side</h4>
    <p>
      The API for the "movies" web application interacts with a database that
      stores data about different movies. The web application provides
      information about other movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign up,
      update their user account information, and create and delete a list of
      their favorite movies. API includes user authentication, authorization
      code, and data validation at relevant endpoints
    </p>
    <h4>Endpoints</h4>
    <table class="table">
      <tr>
        <td>• AddFavoriteMovie - POST</td>
        <td>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • DeleteFavoriteMovie -
          DELETE &nbsp;&nbsp;
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>• DELETEUserAccount - DELETE</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • GETAllMovies - GET</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>• GETAllUsers - GET</td>
        <td>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • GETOneDirector - GET
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>• GETOneGenre - GET</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • GETOneMovie - GET</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>• UpdateUser - PUT</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h4>Screenshot of the endpoints</h4>

    <h4>Client-Side</h4>
    <p>
      I built the client-side for an application called myFlix based on its
      existing server-side code (REST API and database). It is a single-page,
      responsive application developed with React and React-Redux. It has
      different views like the main view (which shows a list of all movies),
      single movie view (where users can view details about the director and
      genre of the film), login view, registration view, and profile view(where
      users can update their user data and see list of favorite movies)
    </p>

    <h3 style="font-size: xxx-large">Challenges:</h3>
    <p>
      This was a challenging project for me. I had to understand React library
      to build the user interfaces, component-based architecture, configuring
      parcel to build the application, and create different components for
      different front-end views. The most challenging part of the application
      was creating client-side App routing. There were conflicts in the
      versions, and I had to refer to many external resources to implement the
      functionality. Thanks to feedback from other developers in the Slack
      channel, tutors, and mentors, I overcame the achievement.
